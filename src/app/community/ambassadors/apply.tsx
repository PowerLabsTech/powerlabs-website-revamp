            Because you want more than just classroom knowledge. As a PowerLabs
            Ambassador, you’ll learn by doing—solving real problems, leading
            high-impact projects, and building your voice as a changemaker on
            campus. <br />
            <br /> You’ll sharpen skills in leadership, communication, tech, and
            research while joining a community that’s reimagining the future of
            energy in Africa. If you want to be known for action, not just
            ambition, this is where you start.
