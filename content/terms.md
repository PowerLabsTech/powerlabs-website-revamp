PowerLabs reserves the right to update, revise, modify, or otherwise, reissue these terms without prior notice. The continued use of your Device and the Platform after any amendment to this Agreement constitutes your acceptance of the Agreement as modified by such amendment.

**Data Protection Roles:** For the purposes of the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) and its subsidiary legislations, PowerLabs acts as a Data Controller with respect to personal data you provide directly (e.g., user identification, contact details, and account information). In certain cases, PowerLabs also acts as a Data Processor on your behalf with respect to operational data collected from your premises by the Device and Platform.

**2\. Purpose of Device Installation:**

PowerLabs shall install a specialized energy management device at the Customer’s premises. The Platform including the device is designed not only to read and transmit real-time data on electricity but also to actively manage and optimize energy usage.

The Platform is designed to **collect, process, and analyze real-time and historical data** to:

- Enable comprehensive real-time energy monitoring.

- Facilitate proactive management by identifying anomalies and deviations.

- Drive optimization for cost reduction.

- Enhance operational efficiency and uptime.

- Provide actionable insights and reporting.

You agree to permit PowerLabs' personnel access to your premises for periodic preventive and corrective maintenance of the energy management device. We reserve the right to remove, replace, or repair the device as necessary for maintenance purposes, providing reasonable notice to You.

We will conduct periodic inspections and maintenance to ensure the device's optimal performance and longevity. This includes but is not limited to, checking electrical connections, ensuring the accuracy of sensors, and updating any hardware components as required.

In addition to physical maintenance, we reserve the right to carry out "Over-The-Air" (OTA) updates on both the device and the associated Platform. These OTA updates involve remotely updating the software or firmware to enhance the functionality, security, and performance of the energy management system. We will notify You in advance of any major updates that may impact the device's operation or require a restart.

**4\. Device Functionality and Utility Costs:**

The installation and operation of this device and access to the Platform will not result in a significant increase in your electricity bills, except for potential increases related to normal usage of the device. We will use our best endeavors to ensure that the energy consumption of the device will be minimal and will not lead to any substantial rise in the overall power utility costs for your premises, barring any standard operational usage fees or charges specifically associated with the device's and Platform’s functionality.

**5\. Payment and Billing**
