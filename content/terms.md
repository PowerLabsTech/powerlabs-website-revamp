### **Gap Analysis & Proposed Updates for Terms and Conditions**

**1\. Explicitly Define Roles (Data Controller & Data Processor)**

- **Current T\&Cs:** Implied through "We" (PowerLabs) and "You" (Customer), but not explicitly stated in NDPR terms.
- **NDPR Info:** Your registration clearly defines PowerLabs as both Data Processor and Data Controller.
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Add a new subsection, possibly under "1. Acceptance of Terms" or a new "Data Protection & Privacy" section.**
  - **Content:** Clearly state PowerLabs' role as a Data Controller and, where applicable, a Data Processor, outlining what these roles entail in relation to the customer's data.
  - **Example Wording:** "For the purposes of the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) and its subsidiary legislations, PowerLabs acts as a Data Controller concerning your personal data and, in certain instances, as a Data Processor regarding the operational data collected from your premises on your behalf."

**2\. Detailed Purpose of Data Processing (More Granular than current Section 2\)**

- **Current T\&Cs (Section 2):** Covers reading and transmitting real-time data for electricity, management, and optimization.
- **NDPR Info (Point 10):** "To deliver comprehensive energy monitoring, management, and optimization services through our products, analyzing energy data for insights on cost reduction, efficiency, and seamless user and device management."
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Update "2. Purpose of Device Installation" to "2. Purpose of Data Collection and Processing."**
  - **Content:** Expand this section to include the explicit purposes from your NDPR form:
    - Real-time energy monitoring (already partially there).
    - Proactive energy management and anomaly detection.
    - Driving energy optimization and cost reduction.
    - Enhancing operational efficiency and uptime.
    - Providing actionable insights and reporting.
    - Managing user accounts and access.
    - Improving product and user experience.
  - **Example Addition:** "The Platform is designed to collect, process, and analyze real-time and historical data to enable comprehensive energy monitoring, facilitate proactive management by identifying anomalies and deviations, drive optimization for cost reduction, enhance operational efficiency and uptime, provide actionable insights through reports, and manage user accounts for seamless service delivery."

**3\. Specific Categories of Personal Data Processed**

- **Current T\&Cs (Section 10):** General "personal information" and "data collected or processed by the device."
- **NDPR Info (Point 11):** Explicitly lists:
  - User Data: Name, email, phone number, user role, assigned locations.
  - Interaction Data: Platform usage, feedback.
  - Operational Data: Energy, device, environmental, cost data linked to locations (with privacy measures).
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Create a new subsection within a dedicated "Data Protection & Privacy" section, or expand Section 10 "Confidentiality" to "Data Privacy and Confidentiality."**
  - **Content:** Clearly enumerate the categories of personal data collected and processed.

- **Recommendation:**
  - **Significantly expand Section 10 (or a new "Data Protection & Privacy" section) with a subsection on "Data Security."**
  - **Content:** Detail the specific measures:
    - Data Encryption (at rest and in transit).
    - Role-based Access Controls.
    - Network Security (firewalls, intrusion detection).

We also leverage the advanced physical security of our cloud infrastructure providers."

**5\. Publicity of Data Subject Rights**

- **Current T\&Cs:** Mentions including "our Privacy Policy" in Section 1 (Acceptance).
- **NDPR Info (Point 15):** Explicitly lists "Publicity of Data Subject Rights" and "Privacy Policy" as implemented.
- **Recommendation:**

  - **Example Wording:** "Your rights as a data subject, including the right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data, are fully respected by PowerLabs. Comprehensive details on how to exercise these rights are provided in our Privacy Policy, which forms an integral part of this Agreement."

**7\. Cookie Consent Mechanism**
